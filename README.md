# TapeOS
An operating system programmed entirely in URCL

tapeos.urcl is currently empty, my main focus at the moment is working on the 8 bit OS.

URCL stands for Universal Reduced Computer Language, and is designed to be a bridge between high level languages and assembly. Join the URCL discord server for more info: https://discord.gg/Nv8jzWg5j8
